# ABX discrimination task  


Used in Kan & Schmid (2019) to test the perception of lexical tones using an Android tablet. 

The audio stimuli 'A', 'B', and 'X' are presented at the same time as "animations" of three characters on the left, right, and center of the screen respectively. (The animation is created by presenting different images. The 'images' sub-folder contains a mock version of these images.) The participant is required to tap on the character corresponding to the correct sound that matches stimulus 'X'. The selected character is highlighted with a rectangular frame (unless the character in the middle is selected, which is not a valid response). 
 
As in the study, there are sixteen (i.e. eight pairs) stimuli, each targeted two times, once as 'A' and once as 'B'. 
The left-side stimulus is always presented first (i.e. it is always stimulus 'A'). The stimuli are presented in two pseudo-randomised lists.

Two training trials are included here.
